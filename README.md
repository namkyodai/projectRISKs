# projectRISKs
Welcome to the projectRISKs wiki!

This Excel tool was created by Nam Lethanh at the time he worked for GHD Pty Ltd. and POMPLUS Consulting Ltd. The tool was created in response to the need of having a simple but practical tool for RISK CONTROL of two large scale Design and Build Construction Projects which were under EPCM. The two authors are Nam Lethanh and Scott Moore, who were the Project Manager and Project Director, respectively, at the time of project implementation.

The method and tool has been used by the Consultants and project management team of the Client and the Contractors.

The Excel tool has VBA code embedded to perform simulation and produce results and visualization of risks for reporting and decision making.

The tool can be customized to be used for other construction projects. Users are at their own risk when working with the tool. Any comment for improving the tool is highly welcomed and appreciated.

Kindly refer to the manuscript (Published in Journal of Construction Engineering and Management - ASCE) for detailed description and explanation of the approach and tool.

Thank you!

Nam Lethanh
